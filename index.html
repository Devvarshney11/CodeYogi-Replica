                <p>CodeYogi offers a totally free 6 months long software engineering training program that guarantees
                    job to
                    youth from low-income families.</p>
                <p>All of our trainers are IIT graduates with stints at pioneering companies of the tsech world. With
                    our
                    extensive network in the industry we scout the right jobs for our students and help them succeed.

                    <h3>STRICT VETTING</h3>
                    <p>Our goal is not to run hobby classes but instead to create job ready candidates. So we are
                        selective in who we train. We conduct a mathematical aptitude test to filter out students who
                        have the raw talent needed for a successful software engineering career. Then we take personal
                        interview to check if they have strong will needed to achieve their dreams.</p>

                    <h3>RIGOROUS TRAINING</h3>
                    <p>Selected students are trained rigorously for 6 months under the guidance of experienced mentors
                        and teaching assistants. Itâ€™s not passive teaching; instead students build a number of apps as
                        part of the curriculum. We keep our curriculum in constant sync with industry needs so that
                        students are not taught anything obsolete in this fast moving tech world.</p>

                        coaching is an integral part of our curriculum. We have a continuous feedback process in place
                        to help you improve and grow.</p>

                        training is complete we help them in getting the right jobs by arranging interviews with our

                <p>This Quote from Talmud is our guiding force:</p>
                <p>"Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly
                    now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it."
                </p>
                <p>So we are just honestly trying to do our bit to help achieve equality of opportunity.</p>
